# Checklist Library App

This is an application with a Ruby on Rails API and a JavaScript front-end built using the React library and Redux middleware. This app allows users to view pre-made checklists, check items off the list as completed, and create new checklists from scratch.

## Installation

You can clone this repo with SSH or HTTPS from https://github.com/catherinesmiley/react-redux-project and open it by typing the below into your terminal:

$ git clone <https://github.com/catherinesmiley/react-redux-project.git>

## Usage

Change directory to server-side and seed the database by running rails db:seed in the terminal.

Run rails server -p 3090 in the terminal, then change directory to client-side and run npm start in the terminal.

The app will open to the home page which has a navigation bar with links to view all checklist categories and to create a new checklist category.
